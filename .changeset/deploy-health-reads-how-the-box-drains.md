"prelim-driver": patch

For operators: The deploy health check now reads whether this box drains continuously or on a timer, and says which posture it read. On a timer-driven box, no drainer between ticks was reported as a fault. It is the normal resting state there, and the check no longer calls it a failure. Where a worker holds the queue open, an absent drainer is still the outage it always was. A posture the check could not read is still a failure, never a pass.
